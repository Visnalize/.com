# Indie Products

<script setup lang="ts">
import IndieProducts from '@components/misc/IndieProducts.vue';

Indie makers, like myself, are individuals who create products and services independently. They are not backed by large corporations or venture capital. They are passionate about their work and strive to create high-quality products that solve real problems.

In an attempt to support indie makers and creators, I have partnered with [IndieBoosting](https://indieboosting.com/) and curated a list of high-quality indie products. Below you can find a variety of products, ranging from productivity, design, chatbot, to development, utility, AI, and more. Feel free to explore and support indie makers by using their products if they meet your needs.

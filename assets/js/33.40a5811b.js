If you want to change from a phone to a PC then this app is for you. It has more than just Windows 7, it also has Win8, Win8.1, WinXp, Win11, Win10, WinVista, Win95, Win3.1, Win2000, and MacOS. There are ads but they don't really pop out too often which makes things better. There are some features that requires ads to unlock but its ok. In overall, 10/10."},{image:"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXbYQwGITwYMZ6Qp032fAolpeeiolVEZDtx7jB0IVlS8A=s50",author:"Leox",date:"January 14, 2022",content:'Omg! It works!!!

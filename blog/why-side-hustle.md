# Why you should have a side hustle

_My workspace before and after upgrading with the money earned from my side hustle_

It's been a while since the last time I wrote and published a blog post. Part of the reason is that I've been busy with a lot of things in life, trying to maintain a balance between my day job and the side hustle, while also spending time to take care of my family, the other part is that I couldn't find a good topic to write about. Today, I decided to bring up the topic of side hustle again, share with you some of my thoughts based on my own experience, and hopefully, you can find some motivation and helpful tips to start your own side hustle.

## What is a side hustle?

> A piece of work or a job that you get paid for doing in addition to doing your main job - _[Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/side-hustle)_

As a non-native English speaker, I didn't know what "side hustle" meant and had absolutely no idea what it was until I actually realized that I was already doing it. Apparently, "side hustle" is a slang for a way to make extra money outside of your day job. It can be a freelance gig, a YouTube channel, an online store, or any other form of work that you do in your free time, on weekends, or after work to earn extra income.

In my case, as soon as I started earning my first dollar from [Win7 Simu](../win7simu/about.md), it has become my side hustle. It's worth mentioning that I didn't start Win7 Simu with the intention of making money, but rather to learn new things and have fun. However, as the project grew, I realized that I could monetize it and turn it into a side hustle as a result. I wrote about this more in detail in my previous [blog post](./building-win7-simu.md#how-it-all-started) if you're interested.

## The benefits

Onto the main topic of this post, here are some reasons why you should consider having a side hustle for yourself:

### Extra income

The first and most obvious benefit of having a side hustle is the extra income that it brings. The money you earn from your side hustle can be extremely helpful in many ways, such as paying off debts, saving for a rainy day, investing in your future, or simply improving your quality of life. An example from my own experience is that the money earned from Win7 Simu was used to upgrade my workspace, which in turn helped me to be more productive and motivated to continue and grow the project. In an even bigger picture, I have seen people getting over their financial struggles during the pandemic and layoffs thanks to their side hustles, some even turned them into full-time jobs and became successful entrepreneurs, with a diversity of [products and services](https://thunhap.online/) that they offer.

However, when it comes to money, it's important to remember that a side hustle is not a get-rich-quick scheme. It requires time, effort, and patience to build and grow, and the income may not be stable or guaranteed. If you're willing to put in the work and stay committed, the rewards can be significant and life-changing.

### Skill development

Another benefit of having a side hustle is the opportunity to learn new skills and gain valuable experience. Whether you're building software, starting a blog, creating a YouTube channel, or running an online store, you'll have the chance to develop a wide range of skills, such as coding, marketing, sales, customer service, project management, and more. These skills can be useful not only in your side hustle but also in your day job and other areas of your life.

For example, I've learned a lot about web development ([specifically front-end](./building-win7-simu.md#the-goal), my area of interest), SEO, marketing, analytics, and other business-related skills from building a side project just as simple as Win7 Simu, which has helped me to grow professionally and personally.

### Networking

Having a side hustle can also help you expand your network and connect with like-minded people. Whether you're collaborating with other creators, working with clients, or engaging with your audience, you'll have the opportunity to meet new people, build relationships, and learn from others. Networking can be extremely valuable in today's digital age, where opportunities are abundant and connections are key to success.

Through Win7 Simu, I've met amazing people, from fellow developers who shared their wealth of knowledge and experience, to potential partners and clients who expressed interest in working together. As an introvert, I found it challenging to network and build relationships, but having a side hustle has pushed me out of my comfort zone and helped me to connect with others in a meaningful way.

### Job security

In today's uncertain economy, having a side hustle can provide an additional layer of security and stability. If you lose your job, face a pay cut, or experience other financial setbacks, your side hustle can help you weather the storm and stay afloat. It can also give you the confidence and peace of mind to pursue your passions, take risks, and explore new opportunities without the fear of failure or financial ruin. As there's a saying that goes "Don't put all your eggs in one basket", having a side hustle can diversify your income streams and protect you from unexpected events.

## The challenges

While there are many benefits to having a side hustle, it's important to acknowledge that there are also challenges that come with it. Here are a few things to consider before starting a side hustle:

### Time commitment

The biggest challenge of having a side hustle is the time required to build and grow it. Balancing your day job, family, social life, and other responsibilities with your side hustle can be difficult and overwhelming. You may find yourself working long hours, sacrificing sleep, and missing out on important events in order to keep up with your side hustle.

I recall many late nights and weekends spent working on Win7 Simu, although there was no actual deadline or pressure to do so, there was a sense of urgency and responsibility to deliver a new feature, get a bug fixed, as a token of appreciation to the users who supported the project, either financially or just by providing helpful feedback. While enjoying it, I was certainly exhausted and burnt out at times, and had to remind myself to take breaks, rest, and recharge. Therefore, as a piece of advice, it's crucial to set boundaries, prioritize what matters most to you, and know when to take a break to avoid burnout and maintain a healthy work-life balance.

### Discipline and motivation

Another challenge of having a side hustle is staying disciplined and motivated to work on it consistently. On one hand, it's easy to procrastinate, or lose interest in your side hustle, especially when you're not seeing immediate results or facing setbacks. On the other hand, getting distracted from your day job and other responsibilities can also happen, and affect your career and social life, in the worst case scenario, it can lead to conflicts and negative consequences.

I have seen myself neglecting my day job a few times to focus on Win7 Simu and felt guilty about it, as I was not giving my best effort and attention to my employer, who paid me a salary and provided me with a stable job. It was a wake-up call for me to re-evaluate my priorities, set clear goals, and establish a routine that works for me. I've learned to be more disciplined, focused, and organized in managing my time and energy.

## Conclusion

Above are some of my thoughts and experiences on why you should have a side hustle, the benefits and challenges that come with it. I hope you find them helpful and inspiring, and that you're motivated to start your own side hustle, or continue working on it if you already have one. Remember that everyone's journey is unique, and there's no one-size-fits-all approach to having a side hustle. It's important to find what works best for you, stay true to yourself, and enjoy the process of learning, growing, and hustling. Good luck and have fun!

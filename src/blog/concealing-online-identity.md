# Why I choose to conceal my online identity

This is just a random topic that I happen to think of when I see a lot of people trying to seek attention on social media. It is not meant to offend anyone, I am not here to judge, but to share my own takes and as a reminder to myself.

If you have been following my activities on the internet, you might have already known that I tend to conceal my identity, keep my personal information to the minimum and use ___Visnalize___ as my online brand and identity whenever possible. It is not because I have anything to hide, but rather, there are some reasons behind:

## 1. Privacy

I have a life outside this virtual space, a real one, real connections with loved ones. I don't need people, whom I have never met in person, to tell me what to do or how I should live my life, nor do I need anyone's sympathy or empathy in my down moments. I am not, and will never intend to be, a public figure. I enjoy the freedom of being a random person, not just on the internet, but also in life, anywhere I go.

Of course, I am not saying that I don't appreciate the support and encouraging from you. I do, I am grateful. And whenever possible, I'm more than happy to share my knowledge and experience. However, there will always be a line that I will never cross, a line that separates my personal life from the online one.

## 2. Security

Sharing too much of personal information online can lead to serious consequences, that I'm well aware of. Account hacking, identity theft, cyberbullying, mental health issues, are just a few examples that can happen to anyone if not careful. There is no country, no law that can govern the internet completely to protect ourselves in this digital age. I believe the best way to protect myself, and my loved ones, is to always be cautious, always be skeptical towards what and whom I share my information with.

## 3. Ethics

The internet can change people, and not always for the better, especially when one is chasing for fame and attention. I do follow people that pique my interest, great people who do great things, share helpful knowledge, and inspire others. But in the process, some of them have revealed their true nature, some have lost their way to money and fame, or to maintain their title and influence. You may say it is their choice for how they want to live their life, and that's totally fair, they have every right to. But for me, to lose my ethics, my values and my principles, in exchange for attention, fame, money, or anything else, is not something worth pursuing.

## 4. Commitment

I have a clear goal of what I want to achieve in life, and to achieve that, I'll set aside any distractions that may hinder the progress. Having to maintain a reputation with an online identity, keep up with the trends, be active on social media etc. are not my priorities, if not necessary. I prefer to spend my time on things that either bring me joy, help me grow, things that really matter to me, or simply, things that I love to do. Keeping my online identity concealed is one of the ways to help me focus on what I want to achieve.

Life is too short to be concerned about what some internet strangers think of me, to become someone they want me to be, or to lose myself in that process. I am not perfect, I have my flaws, my own struggles, but if there's anyone whom I want to seek approval from, it would be the people who really know me, who have been with me through thick and thin, who have seen me at my worst and still choose to stay with me. They are the ones that truly matter to me, the ones that I need to commit my time and effort to, be there for them. And that's why I choose to conceal my online identity.

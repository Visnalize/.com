# Win7 Simu

<a-social />

**Win7 Simu** is a recreation of the Windows 7 operating system on the Web/Android platform. It is built out of pure joy and nostalgia for the sake of reliving the good old time with the elegant Aero and Glassy interface.

## Features

As a simulator of Windows 7, it attempts to simulate every aspect of Windows 7, from the most familiar programs of Windows 7 such as Calculator, Command Prompt, the striking glass effect of the Aero themes, to the exclusive Desktop Gadgets only available in Windows Vista and 7. The simulator also comes with some other cool and nostalgic Windows themes designed on the core of Windows 7 such as Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows 8...

The simulator is in active development and new features are constantly rolled out. If you have suggestions or feedback, please feel free to write to us at [hey@visnalize.com](mailto:hey@visnalize.com).

::: tip Tip
Refer to [Changelog](./changelog.md) for a complete list of available features through versions.
:::

On August 28, 2021, a web version of the app was released. It is accessible for those who do not own an Android device. The graphics, interface, and most of the features are identical to the Android app, except for some, which are exclusive to Android and cannot be replicated for the web due to technical constraints. A comparison of some key features is listed as below:

Feature | Android | Web
--------|:-------:|:---:
Cross-platform support[*](#cross-platform) | ❌ | ✅
Work offline | ✅ | ❌
Can access local files directly with File Explorer[**](#local-files) | ❌ | ❌
Can access local/native apps | ✅ | ❌
Sync settings with online accounts | ✅ | ✅
Multi-theming support | ✅ | ✅
Multi-language support | ✅ | ✅
System notifications | ✅ | ❌

<a name="cross-platform">*</a> It doesn't matter if the device is Android, iOS, Windows, or Mac, as long as it has a web browser and connects to the internet.

<a name="local-files">**</a> The early versions of Win7 Simu were able to access local files on Android devices. However, due to Google Play's [policy](./faq.md#file-explorer-does-not-show-files-on-my-device-what-s-the-problem), this feature was removed from v3.6.0 onwards.

## Pricing

Win7 Simu is and will always remain **FREE** to use. However, as it has been growing in popularity, the time and effort invested in the development and maintenance, as well as the server costs for the app, are also increasing. Therefore, a small subscription was introduced to help cover the costs and keep the service running. The subscription is completely optional and does not affect the core features of the app. It is available at **$1.99/month** or **$19.99/year**. Subscribers will be able to enjoy the app without any ads and may cancel their subscriptions at any time.

*We would like to express our sincere gratitude to all the subscribers who have been supporting us.*

## A bit of the history

**Windows 7** was first released by [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft) on **October 22, 2009**, succeeding Windows Vista, which was criticized for its long development time, performance and compatibility issues at launch, and many other critiques. Windows 7 was well-received and praised, stating it to be a "big improvement" over Windows Vista and a "worthy successor" of Windows XP at the time.

After more than a decade, on **January 14, 2020**, support for Windows 7 ended. Security updates and fixes were no longer provided by Microsoft. However, even on the day of its death, Windows 7 was still the second-most popular operating system with a 32.75% market share, behind Windows 10 with 47.65%, showing how much love it still had.

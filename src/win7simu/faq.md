## 1. Simulator features

### Can I install exe files/Windows programs on this?

No. This is just a simulator. It does not have the necessary infrastructure to run those programs.

### Can you implement the mouse control in the same way as the Win98 Simulator?

No. This simulator uses a different technology approach from the Win98 Simulator, therefore it's not feasible to implement the same.

### IE and Chrome cannot connect to the internet. Can you fix them?

Please keep in mind that this is just a simulator. Web browser functionalities are very limited and are unstable. I'm afraid this is as far I can get to implement them.

### IE and Chrome are too slow. Can you fix them?

No. Please see above.

### IE and Chrome cannot download files/programs. Can you fix them?

No. Please see above.

### Can you add Microsoft Office?

Yes. However, the priority is low and your expectation might not be met. Please keep in mind this is still just a simulator.

### Can you add this feature, that feature and more features?

Yes. If the feature is not rejected above. You can comment your request below in the comment section or write to me at [visnalize@gmail.com](mailto:visnalize@gmail.com).

### Can I use this simulator as a launcher/home screen?

No. The launcher/home screen setting was enabled with version [2.10.0](./changelog.md#_2-10-0), however, due to instability, the simulator was then suffered from declined rating with users complaining that it harmed their devices, therefore, this setting is disabled from version [2.11.1](./changelog.md#_2-11-1) onwards.

### Does this simulator work offline?

Yes. However, certain features such as user accounts, some games and browsers will not work as they require internet connection to connect with the servers.

## 2. How to use

### How do I create a user account?

Please see [this video tutorial](https://youtu.be/4jra0d0Ufag).

### I don't know the password. How do I login?

You can either click on the suitcase to login with the Guest account, or create your own account (see above) and use it to login.

### I have forgotten my password. How to recover it?

Unfortunately, your account is gone if you forget the password, there is no way to recover it.

### How do I open the desktop menu?

To open the desktop menu or any context menu, simply hold your finger for a second.

### How do I bring programs/apps to desktop?

There are currently 2 ways:

* From the Start Menu, hold your finger on the programs/apps you want to add, a context menu should appear, then select "Send to Desktop".
* From the desktop, you can refer to [this video tutorial](https://youtu.be/gz8dPrHsRCs).

### The BIOS keeps showing up for me. How do I enter Windows?

Just don't tap/click on the screen for the first 3 seconds and you will boot into Windows.

## 3. Miscellaneous

### Can you remove the ads?

No, I'm afraid. I have been spending a lot of time and effort to develop and maintain this simulator, it even costs me a fair amount of money to maintain the cloud services to retain your user accounts and settings within. However, there is a monthly subscription plan available with the Android version to which you can subscribe, to enjoy the app ad-free and support me to keep improving it and bring you more cool features.

### Can this simulator work on Android versions earlier than 6.0?

No, I'm afraid. And there is no way to support Android versions older than 6.0 due to certain technical limitations that cannot be resolved.

### The simulator only shows a black screen on my device. What should I do?

Please make sure you have the latest version of [Android WebView](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.webview) installed. It is an important piece that allows Win7 Simu to operate normally on your device. If that didn't solve the problem, please use the [web version](https://win7simu.visnalize.com/) instead.

### My games/apps are not showing in the Start Menu. What's the problem?

This happens on devices with Android 12 or later. Unfortunately, from Android 12+, Google restricts access to the packages (games, apps, etc.) on user devices. There's nothing that can be done about it (see this [version changelog](./changelog.md#_2-23-1)).

### Any plan to publish this simulator to App Store?

Not really. It would be nice but the App Store annual fee is pretty high for me, and I doubt it would get passed the review process due to legal concerns.

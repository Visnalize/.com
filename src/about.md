# About Me

Howdy, glad to see that you are interested to know about me. I am a **full-time software developer** and a **free-time app maker**. I love all sorts of web technologies and visual-related stuff. I tend to spend all of my free time exploring and playing around with those things by making a lot of, probably silly, of-no-use apps, apps that are meant for entertainment, or simply to satisfy my hobby.

I am not good at math and problem solving, or positively speaking, just decent. I cannot build complex programs or software that appears to be useful to mankind, so I took the route that fits me best: **to build apps for entertainment**. If you would like, follow me on [my journey](/blog/) to contribute to the world in my own way.

Tools I use:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
* [Github](https://github.com/)
* [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/sea/products/photoshop.html)
* [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
* [Screenpresso](https://www.screenpresso.com/)

## Visnalize

**Visnalize** is **Visualize** with the letter **u** upside down, my brand name of choice. If you have read above, you should see the reason why I pick this name.

I shamelessly created the logo using MS Paint and eventually on Figma.

# About Me

<script setup lang="ts">
import EmailSender from '@components/misc/EmailSender.vue'

Howdy, glad to see that you are interested to know about me. I am a **full-time software developer** and a **free-time app maker**. I love all sorts of web technologies and visual-related stuff. I tend to spend all of my free time exploring and playing around with those things by making a lot of, probably silly, of-no-use apps, apps that are meant for entertainment, or simply to satisfy my hobby.

I am not good at math and problem solving, or positively speaking, just decent. I cannot build complex programs or software that appears to be useful to mankind, so I took the route that fits me best: **to build apps for entertainment**. If you would like, follow me on [my journey](./blog.md) to contribute to the world in my own way.

Tools I use:

* 1 cheap laptop, 1 used monitor and 1 low-end mobile device
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
* [Github](https://github.com/)
* [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/sea/products/photoshop.html)
* [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
* [Screenpresso](https://www.screenpresso.com/)

## Visnalize

**Visnalize** is **Visualize** (not *Visnalize*) with the letter **u** upside down, my brand name of choice. I did not really care about the name when I first started and having little to no knowledge about branding or marketing, I just picked a name that was somewhat relevant to my interest and went with it, though the letter **u** upside down was a small intentional touch that has luckily helped me stand out from the crowd in terms of [search engine results](https://www.google.com/search?q=visnalize).

The logo is also shamelessly created by myself using MS Paint and eventually on Figma.

## Contact

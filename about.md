# About

Howdy, Visnalize is not an established company or a team, but an individual who is passionate about having fun with software crafting and visual design. I am a __full-time software developer__ and a __free-time app maker__. I love all sorts of web technologies. I tend to spend all of my free time exploring and playing around with those things by making a lot of, probably silly, of-no-use apps, apps that are meant for entertainment, or simply to satisfy my passion.

I am not good at math and problem solving, or positively speaking, just decent. I cannot build complex programs or software that appears to be useful to mankind, so I took the route that fits me best: __to build apps for entertainment__. If you would like, follow me on [my journey](./blog.md) to contribute to the world in my own way.

## Why Visnalize?

__Visnalize__ is __Visualize__ (not _Visnalize_) with the letter __u__ upside down, my brand name of choice. I did not really care about the name when I first started and having little to no knowledge about branding or marketing, I just picked a name that was somewhat relevant to my interest and went with it, though the letter __u__ upside down was a small intentional touch that has luckily helped me stand out from the crowd in terms of [search engine results](https://www.google.com/search?q=visnalize).

The logo is also shamelessly created by myself using MS Paint and eventually on Figma.

## Recreating nostalgia for entertainment

I am attached to the past, and I believe most of us are, things we grew up with, things we used to cherish, things that made us who we are today. With Visnalize, I have defined a mission: __to recreate nostalgia for entertainment__. With the help of technology, I want to relive the good old days, bring back the nostalgia to our daily lives, in a meaningful and entertaining way. If my creations have helped you in any way, don't hesitate to show your support by sharing them with your friends and family, I'm grateful for that.
